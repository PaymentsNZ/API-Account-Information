Changing URL to open-banking-nz

## V0.1.1 - 7/05/2018

- Refactored the following to models and referenced from API paths:
  - Transaction (TransactionModel)
  - Beneficiary (BeneficiaryModel)
  - Standing Orders (StandingOrderModel)
  - Products (ProductModel)
  - Direct Debits (DirectDebitModel)
- Added 501 response code to specification for endpoints not in MVP scope

- Creditor Account updated to reflect BECS format accepted (StandingOrderModel, BeneficiaryModel)

## v0.1.0 - 23/03/2018

- Changed base path to /open-banking/v0.1
- Version bump specification to v0.1.0 to reflect MINOR change to stabilise for pilot

## V0.0.3 - 16/02/2018

- Added AccountRequestResponseModel - this model wraps the AccountRequestModel (model of account access requests) and adds the required response fields. Previously this was done through read-only attributes, however this causes semantic error when used with 'required'. The AccountRequestsResponseModel is syntactically equivalent, allows for required fields and removes the error condition.

## V0.0.2 - 19/12/2017

- Updated info section (contact, licence info, terms of service)
- Corrected 200 response in GET /accounts/{AccountId} - now users PaymentLinks (previously not actually included)

## V0.0.1 - 12/12/2017

- For discussion: used additional 'link' in GET /accounts and GET /accounts/{AccountId} to indicate account is valid for making payments (see PaymentLinks model in specification)
- Created models in 'definitions' section:
  - BalanceModel
  - AccountModel using AccountSchemeModel
  - AccountSchemeModel - enum that allows 'BECS Electronic Credit' - NZ bank account numbers
  - AccountRequestModel
  - Links
  - PaymentLinks
- Updated GET /accounts and GET /accounts/{AccountId} to use AccountModel and PaymentLinks
- Updated GET /accounts/{AccountId}/balances to use BalanceModel and Links (and since this is referred to in GET /balances this is also consistent
- Updated POST /account-requests request and response to use AccountRequestModel
- Updated GET /account-requests to use AccountRequestModel
- Updated request headers to set JWS signature and financial institution identifier as optional
- Left all other resources intact and unchanged (as per MVP directive) - could benefit from resource models being included in 'definitions later'
