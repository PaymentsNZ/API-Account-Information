# Account Information API

## V3.0.0-draft

This is v3.0.0-draft NZ Open Banking Account Information API technical specification. The document has been converted from Swagger 2.0 to OpenAPI 3.0, using the v2.3 final swagger 2.0 document as the basis.

The `AuthorizationParam` definition and references have been removed.  Header parameters named `Authorization` are [ignored in OpenAPI 3](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.3.md#user-content-parametername); `securitySchemes` and `security` should be used instead.

The OpenAPI 3.0 document is [here](account-info-nz-openapi.yaml).
