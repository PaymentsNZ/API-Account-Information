      Unique reference, as assigned by the creditor, to
      unambiguously refer to the payment transaction.
      Usage: If available, the initiating party should
      provide this reference in the structured remittance
      information, to enable reconciliation by the
      creditor upon receipt of the amount of money. If the
      business context requires the use of a creditor
      reference or a payment remit identification, and
      only one identifier can be passed through the
      end-to-end chain, the creditor's reference or
      payment remittance identification should be quoted
      in the end-to-end transaction identification.

      The Particulars, Code and Reference fields are currently constrained by
      providers.  The design choice has been made not to constrain through schema
      restrictions, to allow for future changes that remove the constraint. 
      Note that not all banks will accept all valid characters, in which case a
      descriptive 400 Bad Request will be returned. Constraining to a-z, A-Z, - 
      (dash) and 0-9 is advised. One example is abc-XYZ-123
